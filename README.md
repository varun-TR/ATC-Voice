# ðŸ›« ATC Voice Communications Dashboard (Voice-to-Text)
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is part of the GMU DAEN Capstone (Fall 2025) and focuses on building an Air Traffic Control (ATC) Voice Communications Dashboard.
The system ingests live or recorded ATC audio, converts it into text using Speech-to-Text (STT) models, applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analysis, and visualizes insights in an interactive dashboard.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Ingest and process ATC audio recordings (e.g., LiveATC streams).

Apply Speech-to-Text (STT) models such as Whisper, Vosk, or Azure Speech SDK.

Perform NLP analysis (e.g., keyword spotting, call sign detection, anomaly detection).

Develop a real-time dashboard to visualize:

Transcripts

Communication timelines

Flight activity summaries

Alerts/anomalies
