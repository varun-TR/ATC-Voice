For this project we set up a pipeline to capture live ATC (Air Traffic Control) audio and organize it into smaller and more usable chunks. The live streams came from LiveATC and were received in MP3 format. To manage the data, we wrote a Python script (scrap.py) that connects to the stream, buffers the audio, and then automatically cuts it into thirtyâ€“second chunks. Each file was saved with a timestamp in its name so that we can easily match it back to the exact moment it was recorded.
The output folder of the script was linked directly to a OneDrive account, so as soon as a chunk was created it was syncronized to the cloud. To check that everything was working correctly, we listened to the live stream while keeping the OneDrive folder open. Within half a minute of hearing a transmission, the corresponding audio file would appear in the folder, which confirmed the system was updating in real time.
